            <strong>Our Mission</strong> is to protect and improve the lives of
            community cats through compassionate Trap-Neuter-Return (TNR),
            medical care, and dedicated recovery support. We provide safe
            rehabilitation and socialization for cats and kittens, helping them
            transition into loving homes whenever possible. By reducing
            overpopulation, promoting responsible care, and advocating for the
            voiceless, we strive to create a more humane future where every
            cat-feral or domestic-can live a healthy, dignified life.
            {/* Every cat deserves a safe and loving home. TeamTNR works with local
            rescuers to make that happen through adoption and care programs. */}
